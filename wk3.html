        This website is in honor of the dog love of my life, Tony De Vito AKA Tony Bologna AKA Tones Balones AKA The Good Guy.
        My sweet boy was found wandering the mean streets of Elk Grove in November of 2010. He'd only been at the Sacramento County 
        Bradshaw Animal Shelter for a few days when I met him. He looked so heart-broken and scared in his little cage. The dog
        I asked to see first in the meeting room was named Duke, an 80 lb blue-nosed pitbull who humped the female attendant furiously.
        He was too much dude for me! The attendent had a second suggestion and brought Tony to us (named William at the time). My 
        then pregnant sister would set off each dog's intensity, but not my Tony. He stayed calm and cool, and put his head gently 
        on her knee allowing her to pet him. I was able to take him home for only $50 after they neutered and microchipped him. A best friend for 
        $50 - what a deal!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Over 10 years have passed since our first meeting. I often credit him as being the glue that pulled my boyfriend (now husband) and I together.
        Having something to love together deepened out relationship, and gave me a peek at what kind of parent my husband would become. 
        We have shared so many long walks, tummy scratches, couch snuggles, great naps, and 
        love over these years. He makes me feel safe in bed at night if my husband is out of town for work and when taking a late night walk. 
        He keeps secrets and knows how to make the every day feel lighthearted. He reminds me to live in the present and don't hold grudges.
        His fur is soft and never smells. He is the perfect dog for our family. 
    </p>

        Tony is now a senior and his joints are aching. We know our time with him will come to an end soon, and try to savor the 
        moments we have left with him. Love comes in all shapes, sizes, and species. We are grateful for 
        Tony and the time we have to love him!
